# Skillz

## Overview

\_Skillz is a demo of an e-Learning platform that allows for the orginazation of online course in anything from cooking, dancing, home-improvement or courses on new technologies. This is a full stack app that utilizes Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL for the backend and React for the front.

<br>

## MVP

\_The Skillz Minimum Viable Product will be a Full Crud App that allows users to not only view availabe courses but also create, edit and destroy courses with proper authorization. This app has multiple table associations between participants/instructors/ and courses allowing for different user experiences.

<br>

### Goals

-\_Gain a better understanding and confidence with Ruby on Rails/SQl backend
-\_Fully Responsive Design
-\_Easy to Navigate UX
-\_Very Organized front end architecture

## Post MVP

Going to add a contact form and do either a table for inventory with Material UIs Table or make a with Courses to Students or something to that effect. I just want to be able to play with some type of data visualization. Last step would be to add a shopping cart.
